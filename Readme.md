# Bunyon

Logging is a pain, like a buyon. While [bunyan](https://npmjs.org/package/bunyan) is awesome, it is too complex and DTrace is annoying if you don't really use it.

So bunyon is a cleaner simpler and more extendable logger with the same ideals as bunyan.

## More documentation coming as soon as the package is proven stable by real world use (hopefully 2013-10)
